# Name: change_dates_rename_files.sh
#
# Brief: Command-line Bash script to change Creation Date & Modified Date that  
# are currently download date to photo-taken date. The script also adds
# photo-taken date to the filename, e.g., 2015-09-02_07-09_0059.jpg.
# These changes will make file sorting easier. Takes in 1 command-line 
# parameter, directory_path, the location of the files.
#
# Note: Photo-taken date is exif:DateTimeOriginal.
# Note: Script processes only a single directory.

  ### Filesystem/OS Date Change ###
  # Change filesystem date to EXIF photo-taken date, EXIF:DateTimeOriginal.
  # 1. Replace ALL occurrences of : 	With: nothing
  # 2. Replace 1stÂ occurrence of space 	With: nothing
  # 3. Build string by deleting last 2 char at end. Then concat . & then concat 
  # last 2 char, e.g., abc12 -> abc + . + 12 => abc.12

  # % - means to delete only the following stated chars & keep the rest, i.e., 
  # %${date_for_date_change: -2} - which is the 12 part of abc12 & keep abc
  date_for_date_change="${date_for_date_change%??}.${date_for_date_change: -2}"

  ### Filename Change that includes Date ###
  # Use EXIF photo-taken date, EXIF:DateTimeOriginal, change format & use in filename.
  # 1. Replace last 3 chars, e.g., :17	With: nothing
  # 2. Replace ALL : 	With: -
  # 3. Replace ALL spaces  With: _
